    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>Ripe mangoes (2, peeled and diced)</li>
        <li>Heavy cream (1 cup)</li>
        <li>Whole milk (1 cup)</li>
        <li>Egg yolks (4)</li>
        <li>Honey (½ cup, adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract (1 tsp)</li>
        <li>Lemon juice (1 tbsp, optional, to enhance flavor)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend the mangoes – Puree the diced mangoes in a blender until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the milk and cream – In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the whole milk and heavy cream. Heat until warm but not boiling.</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg yolks and honey – In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks and honey until smooth and slightly pale.</li>
        <li>Temper the eggs – Slowly pour a small amount of the warm milk mixture into the egg yolks while whisking continuously to prevent curdling.</li>
        <li>Cook the custard – Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens slightly and coats the back of a spoon. Do not let it boil.</li>
        <li>Strain and cool – Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps, then let it cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Mix in mango and vanilla – Stir the mango puree and vanilla extract into the cooled custard, mixing well.</li>
        <li>Chill the mixture – Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight for better flavor.</li>
        <li>Churn the ice cream – Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</li>
        <li>Freeze until firm – Transfer the churned ice cream to a container and freeze for at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
    </ol>
